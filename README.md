Assuming you already have [Spaz][5] installed:

 1. In Spaz, switch to the Preferences tab, scroll to the bottom, and click *Open Prefs Folder*. Inside that, open the *userthemes* folder.
 2. Download the [latest version][6] of Leopaz.
 3. Unzip your copy of Leopaz, and drop the resulting folder into the *userthemes* folder.
 4. Restart Spaz.
 5. In Spaz, switch to the Preferences tab again. In the *Interface* section, select *leopaz* from the *Theme* dropdown menu.

Enjoy! Find me on Twitter as [@ronalddevera][7]. Comments and requests are welcome.
