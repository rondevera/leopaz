Installation
------------

Assuming you already have [Spaz][6] installed:

 1. In Spaz, switch to the Preferences tab, scroll to the bottom, and click *Open Prefs Folder*. Inside that, open the *userthemes* folder.
 2. **Important:** If you have a *leopaz* (lowercase) folder already (from a previous version), switch back to the Spaz application, open the *Interface* section, change your theme to the default *spaz*, and quit Spaz.
 3. Download the [latest zip][5] of Leopaz.
 4. Open your downloaded copy to find the *Leopaz* folder. Drop this into the *userthemes* folder.
 5. Restart Spaz.
 6. In Spaz, switch to the Preferences tab again. In the *Interface* section, select *Leopaz* from the *Theme* dropdown menu.


More info

There's more info on CSS customizations and previous changes in the [Leopaz wiki][8]. This code is adapted from Spaz's default theme.
